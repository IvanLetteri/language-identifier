# language-identifier
In this project I use various neural network architectures to predict the language that a word is written in.

# Dependencies

A few python packages are needed for this project. Here is the full list and how to install them:
- numpy: pip install 
- keras: 
- Wikipedia: 
- matplotlib:

To only run the prediction, only keras and numpy are necessary.

The saved data is not included because the files are too big.

# To predict

# To train new model

# Results

The main result is that I am able to achieve an accuracy of 87% on the test data using the CNN. More details about the model and the results can be found in my blog post.
